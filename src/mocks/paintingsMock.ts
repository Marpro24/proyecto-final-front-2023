      "Brooklyn based, Haitian American photographer and creative director, Loug√® Delcy, better known as Dapper Lou. Delcy has traveled much of the African continent documenting indigenous cultures and people. His vibrant visual style, and willingness to dive deep into the exploration of each city has allowed him to make a name for himself as a visual documentarian. Delcy uses his Haitian roots and love of travel as drivers for his creative output and urge to discover and amplify stories that we don't often hear.",

      "At first I didn't have the mainland as my main goal, but an opportunity arose. My first project in Africa was in Kenya, in a non-profit collaboration. I documented the situation of pregnant women in the country. The idea was to put the spotlight on these women, some of whom suffer and die during childbirth. But it was not only photographing them as victims, but also as heroines, women who fight and raise their children. It was the first time I set foot on the continent and that made me very interested in the cultural diversity in these countries..",

      "Asif Hoque is finally feeling grounded. The Italian-born, Florida-raised painter is taking stock of his life and the numerous identities and labels that have been attached to him over the years. And this inner exploration is making its way onto his heroic canvases. In conversation with Platform, Hoque spoke about the importance of depicting melanated figures as powerful, why galleries should invest in the mental health of their artists, and the impetus behind making modern love stories.",

      "I took my loverboy character and rescued the brown Indian figure out of that painting and into a love story. I recreated that painting, but then also included little snippets of what would happen after or before. That's how I'm processing my work now. I want to rescue figures or bring Black and Brown figures to light. That's where the work that I'm showing on Platform comes in. The clouds are being hit by light, the figures are being hit by light, and that makes us powerful. When we look up at the sun and we take these really nice photos of ourselves, because we're full of melanin, we shine. I want to expose that positivity as much as possible in my paintings.",

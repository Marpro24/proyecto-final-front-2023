# La Galerie

La Galerie is a dynamic Single Page Application powered by the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. Designed as an art gallery management system, La Galerie enables users to seamlessly Create, Read, Update, and Delete art pieces within a user-friendly interface. With a sleek and responsive design, art enthusiasts can explore a curated collection, add new artworks, edit details, and remove entries effortlessly. The application leverages the power of MongoDB for flexible data storage, Express.js for robust server-side handling, React for an interactive and engaging user interface, and Node.js for efficient backend operations. La Galerie offers a seamless and immersive experience for art curation and management.

La Galerie ensures code quality and reliability through comprehensive testing using Vitest, a minimalistic test runner for modern JavaScript applications. Additionally, the project embraces version control and collaboration with GIT, allowing for seamless teamwork, version tracking, and codebase management.
